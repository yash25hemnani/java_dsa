         Java always passes variables by value. However, when you pass an
         array (or any object) to a method, Java passes a copy of the
         reference to that object. This means that both the original
         and the copied reference point to the same memory location.
         So, if you modify the array's contents using this reference,
         the changes will be reflected outside the method because the
         same array in memory is being modified.

         For primitive data types (int, double, etc.), a copy of the actual value is passed.
         Modifying this copy doesnâ€™t affect the original variable outside
         the method.
         For immutable objects like String, any "modification" inside a
         method actually creates a new instance, leaving the original
         object unchanged.
